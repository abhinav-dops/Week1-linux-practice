# Week 1: Linux Basics â€“ Practice and Notes

This folder contains my practice files and notes for Week 1 of my DevOps journey, focused on mastering the Linux command line.

## Topics Covered
- Navigating the Linux filesystem
- Creating, copying, moving, and deleting files and directories
- Viewing and searching file contents
- Practicing basic commands on an EC2 Ubuntu instance

I used hands-on exercises with AWS EC2 and terminal-based commands to solidify the fundamentals required for system and cloud-level tasks.
